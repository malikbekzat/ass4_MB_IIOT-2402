Assignment 4: Graph, BFS and DFS Algorithms
Course: CS 2055 (Algorithms and Data Structures) — Academic Year 2025–2026
Type: Individual Work (IW) | Language: Java or C++ | Submission: Report + GitHub
Overview
In this assignment you will implement a small but complete graph toolkit and use it to solve problems with
Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). You must design a clean Graph API, choose an
appropriate internal representation, handle edge cases, and justify time/space complexity.
Learning outcomes
• Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for storing and processing data (graphs).
• Implement BFS and DFS correctly and efficiently on multiple graph representations.
• Analyze runtime performance in terms of input size (|V|, |E|).
• Write clean, testable code and explain your solution during code defense.
Rules and constraints
• Do not use external graph libraries (e.g., NetworkX, JGraphT). You may use standard collections.
• Your solution must compile and run from the command line (or via an IDE project) without manual steps.
• Traversal output must be deterministic (define and document how neighbors are ordered).
• Late submissions are not accepted. You must be ready for oral code defense.
